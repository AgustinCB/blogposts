I'm trying to learn Haskell. While I'm enjoying the process and I'm about to become a fan of static and strong typing, I'm having a very common problem to gasp the idiomatics of the language: monads.

In order to understand it better and get a good idea about it, I decided to do three things:

1. Read the famous paper [Monads for functional programming](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf).
2. Implement the explanation in a language I'm very familiar with (in this case, Javascript).
3. Write a blog post trying to explain that concept.

The objective for me it's to internalise it.
