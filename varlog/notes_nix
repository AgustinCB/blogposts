1.- Install all up to chapter 6.
2.- Install NIX deps:
	- sqlite (https://www.sqlite.org/2016/sqlite-autoconf-3150200.tar.gz)
		- ./configure --prefix=/tools && make && make install
	- pkg-config (from the sources)
		- ./configure --prefix=/tools --with-internal-glib --disable-compile-warnings --disable-host-tool --docdir=/tools/share/doc/pkgconfig && make && make install
	- flex and bison (from sources)
		- ./configure --prefix=/tools && make && make install
	- DBI, DBD::SQLite and WWW::Curl from CPAN.
		- This was TRICKY. First because never had to install a perl module before and I had no idea where to start. So, some points:
			- Your folder /tools/lib/per5/5.24.0/ may not have the headers (a folder called [target-platform]/CORE). Install it isn't easy at all. I had to download a rpm file of the package perl-devel, uncompress it and manually move the headers: mv /path/to/rpm/usr/lib65/perl5/CORE /tools/lib/perl5/5.24.0 && ln -s /tools/lib/perl5/5.24.0 /tools/lib/perl5/5.24.0/[target]
			- To install the modules:
				- curl -L http://cpanmin.us | /tools/bin/perl - --force [module-name]
