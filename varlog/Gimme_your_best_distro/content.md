I have been using Linux for a long time. I think it all started with my first laptop, which had Windows Vista. I think there's nothing more to say there.

My first distro was Ubuntu. I tried different ones, like Debian or Fedora and always felt like it wasn't quite the perfect match. It didn't feel right. There wasn't that connection that a man and a distro should have to start a relationship.

And so I went to Gentoo. I really liked it. I remember passing two days installing stage3 and having the greatest time of my life. However for some reason I really can't remember, I ended up trying other distros.

Eventually, I arrived to Slackware and used it for some years. But the package manager (or lack of) was a pain in the ass. So I decided to move along.

Kali Linux is the last one I have been using. The main reasons being: I like apt tools and it came with all the software I needed installed from the beginning. I have been using it for years and I'm still using, but that feeling that this is not the distro for me.

I decided to go hard. I would install LFS and add a package manager. Install all I like and my usual stuff and I'd have my perfect distro. I tried first using packman and following [this instructions](http://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/hints/2013-March/003304.html). After a frustrating first attempt, it didn't go very well.

This week, however, I learned about [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and saw the light. I was love at first sight. What all that cheesy songs were always talking about. And decided to commit to it: I'd install LFS with the Nix package manager. I'd use this blog to log that and write a nice tutorial about how to do it. You'll be hearing from me.
