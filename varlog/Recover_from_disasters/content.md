# Recover from disasters

So I did something stupid. About 6 months back, I got two new hard
disks for my laptop. In one, I installed basically the same setup that
I already had (Arch linux) but using BTRFS instead of EXT4. In the 
other, I installed Windows 10 through a virtual machine. I then
proceeded to swap the first disk with the main disk of my laptop and to
completely forget about the second one (because, you know, _Windows_).

Ten days ago, I started doing a tutorial on how to program games in C++
using Unreal. After suffering much with the Linux version, I took the 
disk with windows installed, used a "sata to usb" interface and boot it
on a virtual machine.
